# Spielwelt 1: Stadt — Bild-Prompt (v2)

## Prompt

Illustrated children's play carpet showing a small European town, seen from a slightly tilted bird's eye perspective — not strictly top-down, but angled just enough to see the fronts and sides of buildings. Think classic Wimmelbilder or 90s European play mats. Cheerful, warm, colorful, flat illustration style with clean outlines.

The town contains:

- A network of grey roads with white dashed center lines, connecting everything — straight sections, curves, T-junctions, a roundabout
- A red fire station with a big garage door and a fire department symbol
- A white hospital with a red cross
- A yellow school with a small schoolyard
- Several residential houses in warm colors — terracotta, cream, light blue, sage green — with small gardens, fences, flower beds
- A bakery or café with an awning and outdoor seating
- A small church with a steeple
- A lake with blue water, organic shape, with a small wooden dock
- A park with grass, a playground (swing, slide, sandbox), benches
- A soccer field with white lines
- Trees lining the streets — round leafy treetops, varying sizes
- A large green meadow on one edge
- Crosswalks at intersections
- A parking lot near the school
- A small bridge over a stream that feeds into the lake
- Hedges and flower beds around houses

No text, no labels, no street names, no signs with writing. Buildings are identified by their visual appearance and symbols only (red cross for hospital, bell on church, etc.).

No vehicles, no cars, no trucks anywhere in the image — the roads should be empty. Vehicles will be added separately as game sprites.

Style: flat, colorful, slightly naive children's illustration. Warm palette — rich greens, warm roof colors, medium grey roads. Clean but not sterile. Charming, handmade feel. Not photorealistic, not 3D rendered, not isometric pixel art.

Square format, at least 4096×4096 pixels, filled edge to edge, no border.

## Negative Prompt

photorealistic, 3D render, dark colors, neon, night scene, text, labels, writing, street names, signs with words, vehicles, cars, trucks, people, characters, watermark, logo, border, frame, pixel art, isometric grid
